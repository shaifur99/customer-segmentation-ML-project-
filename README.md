# 🛒 Customer Segmentation using RFM and KMeans

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** and **K-Means clustering**.  
The dataset used is the **Online Retail dataset**, which contains transactional data for a UK-based retail company between 2010 and 2011.

By applying RFM metrics and clustering techniques, we group customers into meaningful categories such as **Diamond, Gold, Silver, D Grade, and E Grade**. This enables businesses to better understand customer behavior and design **targeted marketing strategies**.

## 🔑 Key Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset (`OnlineRetail.csv`).  
- Removed null values and invalid transactions.  
- Converted dates and aggregated customer purchase history.  

### 2. RFM Feature Engineering
- **Recency:** Number of days since the last purchase.  
- **Frequency:** Total number of invoices per customer.  
- **Monetary:** Total revenue generated by each customer.  

### 3. Clustering with KMeans
- Scaled the RFM features for better clustering.  
- Applied **KMeans (k=5)** to segment customers.  
- Assigned cluster labels to each customer.  

### 4. Cluster Labeling
Interpreted and renamed clusters into meaningful customer segments:  
- **Diamond 💎:** Top customers, high value  
- **Gold 🥇:** Frequent buyers, good spenders  
- **Silver 🥈:** Moderate customers  
- **D Grade 📉:** Low-value but active customers  
- **E Grade ❌:** Dormant or least valuable customers

## 📊 Results

### Customer Segmentation Count

| Group    | Count |
|----------|-------|
| D Grade  | 2911  |
| E Grade  | 1071  |
| Silver   | 365   |
| Gold     | 21    |
| Diamond  | 4     |

**Observations:**  
- Customers with high frequency and monetary value are grouped into **Diamond** and **Gold**.  
- Most customers fall into **D** and **E Grade**, indicating a long-tail distribution in e-commerce.

## 💡 Business Insights
- **Diamond & Gold customers:** Prioritize with loyalty programs, exclusive offers, and personalized services.  
- **Silver customers:** Nurture with retention campaigns to move them toward Gold.  
- **D & E Grade customers:** Implement reactivation campaigns (discounts, reminders, engagement strategies).
