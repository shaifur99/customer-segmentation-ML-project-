🛒 Customer Segmentation using RFM and KMeans
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering. The dataset used is the famous Online Retail dataset, which contains transactional data for a UK-based retail company between 2010 and 2011.

By applying RFM metrics and clustering techniques, we group customers into meaningful categories such as Diamond, Gold, Silver, D Grade, and E Grade. This allows businesses to better understand customer behavior and design targeted marketing strategies.

🔑 Key Steps

Data Preprocessing

Loaded and cleaned the dataset (OnlineRetail.csv).

Removed null values and invalid transactions.

Converted dates and aggregated customer purchase history.

RFM Feature Engineering

Recency: Number of days since the last purchase.

Frequency: Total number of invoices per customer.

Monetary: Total revenue generated by each customer.

Clustering with KMeans

Scaled the RFM features for better clustering.

Applied KMeans (k=5) to segment customers.

Assigned cluster labels to each customer.

Cluster Labeling

Interpreted and renamed clusters into customer segments:

Diamond 💎 (Top customers, high value)

Gold 🥇 (Frequent buyers, good spenders)

Silver 🥈 (Moderate customers)

D Grade 📉 (Low-value but active customers)

E Grade ❌ (Dormant or least valuable customers)

📊 Results

Customer Segmentation Count

Group	Count
D Grade	2911
E Grade	1071
Silver	365
Gold	21
Diamond	4

Customers with high frequency and monetary value are grouped into Diamond and Gold.

Most customers fall into D and E Grade, indicating a long-tail distribution in e-commerce.

💡 Business Insights

Diamond & Gold customers should be prioritized with loyalty programs, exclusive offers, and personalized services.

Silver customers can be nurtured with retention campaigns to move them toward Gold.

D & E Grade customers may need reactivation campaigns (discounts, reminders, or engagement strategies).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy → Data preprocessing & RFM calculation

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization

Scikit-learn → KMeans clustering, scaling

🚀 Future Improvements

Try other clustering methods (Hierarchical, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models).

Use silhouette score or elbow method to optimize k.

Build a dashboard (Power BI/Tableau/Streamlit) for interactive customer segmentation visualization.
